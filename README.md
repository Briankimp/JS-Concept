Javascrit Fundamental Concepts

Statements are commands that perform action
STatements are separated with a semi colon but the colon can be omitted when a line break exists.

## Example

```javascript
alert("Hello");

# These are 2 statements
alert("Hell0"); alert("Hello");
```

## Commenting

Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk `/*` and end with an asterisk and a forward slash `*/`.

## Use Strict

itis invluded at the top f the script to make the script work in a modern way.

```javascript
"use strict'

```

## Variables

Variables are named storage for data
Example

```js
let Developer;
Developer = "Brian";
alert(Developer);

// You can declare multiple Variables
let user = "Brian",
  age = 21,
  message = "I Work Hard";
// Single Lines are largely recommended though
let user = "Brian",
  age = 21,
  message = "I Work Hard";
// or
let user = "Brian";
let age = 21;
let message = "I Work Hard";
```

Const Can alsoe be used to declare variables dif is that the declared Vars are not reassigned and cannot be but in let the

### Variable Naming

1. Name must contain only letters, digits or the symbols $ and \_.
2. The first Character Must Not be a digit.
// Javascript is case Sensitive btw.
A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores.
Agree on terms within your team and in your mind. If a site visitor is called a “user” then we should name related variable
const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
